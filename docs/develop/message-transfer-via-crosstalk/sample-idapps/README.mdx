This section will include a step-by-step guide to building truly cross-chain dApps by leveraging Router's infra. We'll showcase this guide with the help of some basic cross-chain applications like cross-chain Ping Pong (message transfer) and cross-chain ERC1155 (NFT transfer). This guide will make use of the cross-chain communication framework described earlier and will include code snippets and explanations for each step involved in the process.

:::info
Recognizing that different developers work on different tech stacks, we have included guides for all types of chains supported by Router.
